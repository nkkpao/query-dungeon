# Specification Quality Checklist: Postgres Query Dungeon

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-05-17  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No accidental implementation details beyond explicit training-lab constraints
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification beyond explicit constraints

## Notes

- Validation passed. PostgreSQL, TypeScript + Node.js, local environment, plans,
  SQL, indexes, and CLI runner references are treated as explicit product/domain
  constraints from the request and project constitution rather than accidental
  implementation leakage.
